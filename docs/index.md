## Conclusion

!!! Abstract "Narrative"
A tale of a yuletide trip<br/>
That started from a tropic port,<br/>
Aboard this tiny ship<br/>
Santa and his helpful elves<br/>
To Geese Islands did go<br/>
Continuing their merry work<br/>
O'er sand instead of snow<br/>
New this year: a shiny tool<br/>
The elves logged in with glee<br/>
What makes short work of many tasks?<br/>
It's ChatNPT. It's ChatNPT<br/>
From images to APIs<br/>
This AI made elves glad<br/>
But motivations were unknown<br/>
So was it good or bad?<br/>
Could it be that NPT<br/>
Was not from off-the-shelf?<br/>
Though we'll forgive and trust again<br/>
We'd found a naughty elf<br/>
This fancy AI tool of ours<br/>
With all our work remained<br/>
Not good or bad, our online friend<br/>
Just did as it was <br/>
Surely someone's taint must be<br/>
Upon our AI crutch<br/>
Yes indeed, this bold new <br/>
Bore Jack Frost's icy touch<br/>
We'll all be needed once again<br/>
When Santa's back on snow<br/>
