    Hey there, friend! Piney Sappington here.
    You look like someone who's good with puzzles and games.<br/>
    I could really use your help with this Elf Hunt game I'm stuck on.<br/>
    I think it has something to do with manipulating JWTs, but I'm a bit lost.<br/>
    If you help me out, I might share some juicy secrets I've discovered.<br/>
    Let's just say things around here haven't been exactly... normal.<br/>
    So, what do ya say? Are you in?<br/>
    Oh, brilliant! I just know we'll crack this game together.<br/>
    I can't wait to see what we uncover, and remember, mum's the word!.<br/>

## Solution

After inspecting web application we have found cookie is JWT Token which we were able to decode using cyberchef

```
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzcGVlZCI6LTUwMH0.

Also decoding using Base64 we got initial info:
{"alg":"none","typ":"JWT"}>{"speed":-500}>

decoded using JWT Decoder:
{
    "speed": -500
}
```

Then encoded JWT Token into new hash with speed -100

```

    Well done! You've brilliantly won Elf Hunt! I couldn't be more thrilled. Keep up the fine work, my friend!<br/>
    What have you found there? The Captain's Journal? Yeah, he comes around a lot. You can find his comms office over at Brass Buoy Port on Steampunk Island.
