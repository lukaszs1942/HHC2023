??? quote "Eve Snowshoes"
    I'm Eve Snowshoes, resident tech hobbyist, and I hear Alabaster is in quite the predicament.<br/>
    Our dear Alabaster forgot his password. He's been racking his jingle bells of memory with no luck.<br/>
    I've been trying to handle this password recovery thing parallel to this hashcat business myself but it seems like I am missing some tricks.<br/>

## Solution

We have been given access to Terminal where all files can be found under working directory:
```bash
elf@638721c8f7c9:~$ ls
HELP  hash.txt  password_list.txt
elf@638721c8f7c9:~$
elf@638721c8f7c9:~$ cat hash.txt

```
* Determine the hash type in hash.txt and perform a wordlist cracking attempt to find which password is correct and submit it to /bin/runtoanswer .*

Looking at help we determined hashtype and run command:
  18200 | Kerberos 5 AS-REP etype 23                       | Network Protocols

```bash
hashcat -w 1 -u 1 --kernel-accel 1 --kernel-loops 1 -m 18200 hash.txt password_list.txt --force
```

And this was final output:
