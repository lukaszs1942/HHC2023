??? quote "Chimney Scissorsticks"
    You may have noticed some mischief-makers planning to stir up trouble ashore.<br/>
    They've made many radio broadcasts which the captain has been monitoring with his new software defined radio (SDR).<br/>
    The new SDR uses some fancy JWT technology to control access.<br/>
    The captain has a knack for shortening words, some sorta abbreviation trick.<br/>
    Not familiar with JWT values? No worries; just think of it as a clue-solving game.<br/>
    I've seen that the Captain likes to carry his journal with him wherever he goes.<br/>
    If only I could find the planned "go-date", "go-time", and radio frequency they plan to use.<br/>
    Remember, the captain's abbreviations are your guiding light through this mystery!
    Once we find a JWT value, these villains won't stand a chance.<br/>
    The closer we are, the sooner we'll be thwarting their pesky plans!
    We need to recreate an administrative JWT value to successfully transmit a message.<br/>
    Good luck, matey! I've no doubts about your cleverness in cracking this conundrum!
