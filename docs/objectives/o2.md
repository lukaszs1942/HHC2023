## Solution

First of all started interacting with web application to analyze underlying technologies. We quickly discover that we are interacting with JS. 

!!! info "ChatGPT"
    The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JavaScript. Each element in an HTML document is represented as a node in the DOM tree. This tree structure allows developers to access and manipulate HTML elements in a hierarchical manner.

Secondly we inspected frame where game was loaded. Looking into different elemenets we discovered window.player node. Manipulating window.player.body.height I was able to make model so tinny and it was unbetable. On top of that we also found  window.playersHitBoxSize which was also providing similar results. To aid speed of throwwing snowballes we make use of :  window.player.throwDelay=1.

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
