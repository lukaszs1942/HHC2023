**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective Game0.gb](https://gamegosling.com/vol2-akHB27gg6pN0/rom/game0.gb)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Find the second Gamegosling cartridge and beat the game

??? quote "Tinsel Upatree"
    I can't believe I was actually able to find this underground cavern!<br/>
    I discovered what looked liike an old pirate map in the attic of one of those huts in Rainraster Cliffs, and it actually led somewhere!<br/>
    But now that I've seen where it leads, I think this might've been a bad idea. This place is scary! Maybe you want to take it from here?


## Hints

??? tip "Gameboy 2"
    1) This feels the same, but different! 2) If it feels like you are going crazy, you probably are! Or maybe, just maybe, you've not yet figured out where the hidden ROM is hiding. 3) I think I may need to get a DIFFerent perspective. 4) I wonder if someone can give me a few pointers to swap.

??? tip "Gameboy 2"
    Try poking around Pixel Island. There really aren't many places you can go here, so try stepping everywhere and see what you get!

## Solution

We have been informed that two versions of the game are available, and the game can also be accessed through a badge.

??? tip "Tip"
    Tinsel Upatree: Did you know that many games had multiple versions released? Word is: volume 2 has 2 versions!

Once we started playing game we found a place where we couldn't pass and T-wiz force was not letting us through!

Quickly looking into Network console we found a gameboy ROM which could be downloaded. 

https://gamegosling.com/vol2-akHB27gg6pN0/rom/game0.gb 

There was mentioned second version under same URL with game1.gb name.

https://gamegosling.com/vol2-akHB27gg6pN0/rom/game1.gb

AS next step we loaded both GB files using Game Boy Advance emulator. We can see each version of the game situate us on different location.

To look deeper into the GB features we inspected images using Hex editor "HxD Hex Editor.exe"

To also make it more visible we can use XXD and diff linux tools to find

Offset 18515 is interesting point where data manipulation gives us possiblity to spawn character in different location.

## Response

    At least it's obvious where this one is. See that shiny spot over to the right? That's gotta be where it is! If only I had a bird's eye view.<BR/>
    But how to get there? Up? Down? Left? Right? Oh well, that's your problem now!<BR/>
    Come back if you can find your way to it, and I'll tell you some secrets I've heard about this one.
