    What am I doing in this saloon? The better question is: what planet are you from?<br/>

## Hints

??? tip "Linux Privilege Escalation Techniques"
    There's various ways to escalate privileges on a Linux system.https://payatu.com/blog/a-guide-to-linux-privilege-escalation/

??? tip "Linux Command Injection"
    Use the privileged binary to overwriting a file to escalate privileges could be a solution, but there's an easier method if you pass it a crafty argument..

## Solution

After grabbing console access to terminal we started exploring interesting files on filesystem

```
find / -perm -u+s 2>/dev/null
```

### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
