## Solution

Upon reviewing the instructional material provided by Chris's video, our initial approach started with rotating numbers on first poistion. After putting pressure on open button we are looking for resistance in rotation. Whenever we find resistance on given number we continute adding pressure and hoping onto next position to find opening combination. We should also listen carefully to sounds which might help us finding right combination.

Once we inspected web application we were able to  spot WebSocket communication as well.
