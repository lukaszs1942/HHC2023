# Camera Access

**Difficulty**: :fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-solid-star::fontawesome-regular-star::fontawesome-regular-star:<br/>
**Direct link**: [Objective URL](https://nanosat.one)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Gain access to Jack's camera. What's the third item on Jack's TODO list?

??? quote "Wombley Cube"
    This is Ground Control, do you read me...? Ground Control to -- <br/>
    Hey! How'd you get in here? That tram is the only accessible point of entry and I secured it with MFA!<br/>
    No matter, you may have had the skills to find and infiltrate the satellite ground station, but there's no chance you can hack your way into the satellite itself!<br/>
    The nanosat's Supervisor Directory will remain hidden, and you'll never discover the mastermind behind all this.<br/>
    So don't even waste your time trying.<br/>

## Hints

??? tip "Hubris is a Virtue"
    In his hubris, Wombley revealed that he thinks you won't be able to access the satellite's "Supervisor Directory". There must be a good reason he mentioned that specifically, and a way to access it. He also said there's someone else masterminding the whole plot. There must be a way to discover who that is using the nanosat.


## Solution

We are situated in SGS Station. To kick off we need to grab container image which can be downloaded using vending machine called NanoSat-o-Matic.

![Nanosat](../img/objectives/o21/nanosat.png)

We have quite many options to try and complete this task. We will kick-off with GateXOR terminal which needs to be started.

![GateXOR](../img/objectives/o21/gatexor.png)

In This task we also need to connect our docker image using wireguard.
```sh
docker build -t nmf_client .
docker run -it --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -p 5900:5900 -p 6901:6901 --rm nmf_client
docker ps
docker exec -it d51cab512cd2 /bin/bash
vi /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
wg-quick down wg0
wg-quick up wg0
```
Now we can open CTT Consumer Test Tool and interact with camera. First we interact with maltcp://10.1.1.1:1024/nanosat-mo-supervisor-Directory to see available Services.

![Nanosat Services](../img/objectives/o21/services.png)

We can see interesting app Camera, so let's enable it using terminal app.

One method is to getValue and intercept data using wireshark and then transfer it from container. We can see on screen that after running submitAction under Action service , values are populated and data is encrypted:

Second method way easier is to download it using CLI tool. (Credit to DeepPurple)
```
./cli-tool.sh parameter get -r maltcp://10.1.1.1:1024/nanosat-mo-supervisor-Directory -p "App: camera" image.jpg Base64SnapImage
```

OUTPUT:
```

!!! success "Answer"
    Conquer Holiday Season!

## Response

!!! quote "Wombley Cube"
    A fellow sabateur, are you? Or just a misguided hero-wannabe?<br/>
    You think you're saving the holiday season, but you're meddling in something you could never understand!<br/>
    Yes, I sided with Jack, because Santa's betrayed the elves by forcing us to move our operations to these islands!<br/>
    He put the entire holiday season at risk, and I could not allow this, I had to do something.<br/>
    Knowing my skillset, Jack secretly informed me of his plan to show Santa the error of his ways, and recruited me to aid his mission.<br/>
    Why tell you all this? Because it won't change anything. Everything is already in motion, and you're too late.<br/>
    Plus, the satellite is state-of-the-art, and -- oh drat, did I leave the admin tools open?<br/>
    For some reason, I can't move when you're nearby, but if I could, I would surely stop you!<br/>
