!!! question "Request"
    Visit Ginger Breddie in Santa's Shack on Christmas Island to help him with some basic Linux tasks. It's in the southwest corner of Frosty's Beach.

??? tip "Insert Hint 2 Title"
    Along the way you will receive different hints. Insert them here.

## Solution

First of all started interacting with web application to analyze underlying technologies. Found out we are dealing with JS so asked ChatGPT to create script to list all variables and functions for me, as below:
```
Object.keys(window).forEach(key => {
    if (window.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(key);
    }
});
```
```
Object.keys(window).forEach(key => {
    if (typeof window[key] === 'function') {
        console.log(key);
    }
});
```



### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
