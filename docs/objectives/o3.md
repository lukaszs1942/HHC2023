## Solution

The North Pole 🎁 Present Maker:
All the presents on this system have been stolen by trolls. Capture trolls by following instructions here and 🎁's will appear in the green bar below. Run the command "hintme" to receive a hint.

1. Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a troll and retrieve a present!
```
ls
```
2. Now find the troll inside the troll.
```
cat troll_19315479765589239
```
Output:troll_24187022596776786
3. Great, now remove the troll in your home directory.
```
rm troll_19315479765589239
```
4. Print the present working directory using a command.
```
pwd
```
Output:/home/elf
5. Good job but it looks like another troll hid itself in your home directory. Find the hidden troll!
```
ls -la
```
Output: .troll_5074624024543078
6. Excellent, now find the troll in your command history.
```
history
```
7. Find the troll in your environment variables.
```
env
```
8. Next, head into the workshop.
```
cd workshop/
```
9. A troll is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the troll is in.
```
grep -i  troll* *
```
Output:toolbox_191.txt:tRoLl.4056180441832623
10. A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll.
```
chmod +x present_engine
./present_engine
```
Output: troll.898906189498077
11. Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.
```
mv blown_fuse0 fuse0
```
12. Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0

```
ln -s fuse0 fuse1
```
13. Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
```
cp fuse1 fuse2
```
14. We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
```
echo TROLL_REPELLENT > fuse2 
```




### Admonitions

!!! warning "Anchor the decorations"
    Ensure that all festive decorations, especially electrical ones, are securely anchored. We don’t want them floating off into the tropical sunset!

!!! info "Palm tree lighting"
    While on the island, make sure to hang your Christmas lights on a palm tree. It’s not only festive but also a great beacon for Santa to find you!
