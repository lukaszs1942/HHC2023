**Direct link**: [Objective 4 website](https://hhc23-reportinator-dot-holidayhack2023.ue.r.appspot.com)

## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Noel Boetie used ChatNPT to write a pentest report. Go to Christmas Island and help him clean it up.

??? quote "Noel Boetie"
    Hey there, Noel Boetie speaking! I recently tried using ChatNPT to generate my penetration testing report.</br>
    I need some guidance in finding any errors in the way it generated the content, especially those odd hallucinations in the LLM output.


## Hints

??? tip "Terminal: Reportinator"
    I know AI sometimes can get specifics wrong unless the prompts are well written. Maybe chatNPT made some mistakes here.


## Solution

Tried to use chatgpt, bing and other free tools to check for halucionations, so finnaly switched to burp to bruteforce and check for all combinations in hope to find status code 200 :)
