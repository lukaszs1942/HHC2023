## Objective

!!! question "Request"
    Find the first Gamegosling cartridge and beat the game


??? quote "Dusty Giftwrap"
    The name's Angel Candysalt, the great treasure hunter!<br/>
    A euphemism? No, why do people always ask me that??<br/>
    Anyways, I came here to nab the treasure hidden in this ship graveyard, only to discover it's protected by this rusted maze.<br/>
    That must be why all these old ships are here. Their crew came to find the treasure, only to get lost in the labrynth.


## Hints

??? tip "Buried Treasures"
    There are 3 buried treasures in total, each in its own uncharted area around Geese Islands. Use the gameboy cartridge detector and listen for the sound it makes when treasure is nearby, which gets louder the closer you are. Also look for some kind of distinguishing mark or feature, which could mark the treasure's location.

??? tip "Bird's Eye View"
    The location of the treasure in Rusty Quay is marked by a shiny spot on the ground. To help with navigating the maze, try zooming out and changing the camera angle.

## Solution

Once we found first cartridge we were able to play a game where we had to fix QR Code.
